a simple conglomeration of my favorite static site generating tools,
as well as how i format my websites myself

tools:
- saait (https://git.codemadness.org/saait/) [ISC]
- smu (https://github.com/Gottox/smu) [MIT]
- entr (https://github.com/eradman/entr) [ISC] [libs: 2-term BSD & ISC]
- darkhttpd (https://github.com/emikulic/darkhttpd) [ISC]
- nq (https://github.com/leahneukirchen/nq.git) [CC0 1.0]

legal stuff:

any file that is explicitly marked with the apache2 license blurb
with my name (Ryan Horne) is licensed as "sssgen", otherwise the tools
(subrepositories; see "tools:" bullet list) have their own licenses
and may have files that are not marked explicitly. see each subrepo's
LICENSE or COPYING file for the owner's licensing info.
